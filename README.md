# project

An important component of my master's degree, MSc in Data Science and Statistics, in the University of Bath was the final thesis/dissertation project. My dissertation project is based on spatial analysis and statistics adding a temporal term as well, and investigates Covid-19 in the country of Cyprus. More precisely, my dissertation project with the title 'Investigating the efficiency of measures taken by the Cypriot govrnment for the prevention of Covid-19 pandemic using spatiotemporal analysis' aimed to investigate the propagation of the coronavirus diseases during one year period since the start of the pandemic in the Republic of Cyprus, in order inferences could be drawn according to response measures implemented. 

This repository contains my dissertation project alongside with the code implemented and datasets used.
